# Centralized port assignments for CortexDx.
# Source this file (e.g. `set -a && source config/port.env`) before running service scripts
# to keep LaunchAgent, CLI, and inspector tooling on the same ports.

# Primary HTTP server + MCP endpoint port used by `packages/cortexdx/src/server.ts`
# and the macOS LaunchAgent scripts.
PORT=5001
CORTEXDX_SERVER_PORT=5001

# Optional override for the MCP Inspector's stdio proxy. Leave commented to let
# CortexDx auto-allocate an available port each run; set to a number if you need
# a deterministic port for firewall rules.
# CORTEXDX_INSPECTOR_PROXY_PORT=6277

# Placeholder for future port reservations (tunnels, dashboards, etc.).
# Uncomment and adjust as additional services are introduced.
# CORTEXDX_TUNNEL_PORT=0
