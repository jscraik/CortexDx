# Introduction

The Agent Toolkit provides shell wrappers and recipes that expose search, codemod, diff review and validation capabilities through a uniform JSON interface. It solves fragmentation in tooling by offering deterministic outputs suitable for automated agents.

## Features
- Regex, semantic and structural search wrappers
- Comby and AST-grep codemod helpers
- Tree-sitter query support
- Difftastic structural diff review
- Validator runners for ESLint, Ruff, Cargo and Pytest
- Safe patch application with dry-run and backup
